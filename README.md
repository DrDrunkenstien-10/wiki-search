# WikiSearch â€“ A Simple Search Engine using Inverted Index

## ðŸ“– Overview

**WikiSearch** is a simple search engine built in Java that demonstrates the concept of the **Inverted Index**â€”the core data structure behind modern search engines like Google.

The project works by:

- Fetching Wikipedia articles (20 predefined topics) and saving them locally as text files.
- Building an inverted index from those documents by tokenizing words, filtering out stop words, and mapping each word to the set of documents it appears in.
- Searching for a word to quickly find all the documents containing it.

This project was built as a learning exercise to understand how search engines work at their core.

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

I was inspired to build this project after watching this excellent YouTube video:  
ðŸ‘‰ **Inverted Index - The Data Structure Behind Search Engines**

After watching it, I wanted to go beyond theory and implement my own mini search engine using the inverted index concept. This hands-on implementation helped me solidify my understanding of indexing, tokenization, and search.
